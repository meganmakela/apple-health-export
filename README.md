# health-export

Export Apple Health samples to database using Shortcuts and serverless function. 
Based off of https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/build-personal-health-api-shortcuts-serverless. 

## Todo: 
- [ ] Update Shortcut to sample additional health information (include sample type and units?) 
- [ ] Decide on database and structure for storage (Airtable?)
- [ ] Adjust health entry fields to reflect database structure. 
- [ ] Update function script to create/update records in chosen database. 
- [ ] Move Shortcut to Automations for automated daily export.
